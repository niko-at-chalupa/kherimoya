# Kherimoya - Minecraft Bedrock Server Through [Endstone](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone)
</div>

> [!WARNING]
> This version of Kherimoya is **unfinished and does not work as of now**.
>
> This is the version where I upgrade the scripts, and right now it's unfinished.

## introduction
Kherimoya *(right now)* does not do much. For now, Kherimoya only sets up a "kherimoya" environment that is just a folder set up with Endstone.

Kherimoya is very early in its development, and right now is only good for managing multiple servers, and right now isn't very good compared to just using Endstone.

## kheremara
Kheremara is an umbrella identity used for things like plugins *(just plugins right now)* that utilize Kherimoya's features like its file structure

It's also its own project, in a way.

## features

## planned features

    <li>Better scripts, ones that do not rely on a project path declared in the scripts
