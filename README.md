# Kherimoya - Minecraft Bedrock Server Through [Endstone](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone)
</div>

> [!WARNING]
> This version of Kherimoya is **unfinished and does not work as of now**.
>
> This is the version where I upgrade the scripts, and right now it's unfinished.

## introduction
Kherimoya *(right now)* does not do much. For now, Kherimoya only sets up a "kherimoya" environment that is just a folder set up with Endstone.

Kherimoya is very early in its development, and right now is only good for managing multiple servers, and right now isn't very good compared to just using Endstone.

## kheremara
Kheremara is an umbrella identity used for things like plugins *(just plugins right now)* that utilize Kherimoya's features like its file structure

It's also its own project, in a way.

## features

## planned features
The following features <strong>WILL</strong> be included in Kherimoya in the future.
<ul>
    <li>Kherimoya endstone plugin, that can do things like tell the status of the server and communicate with Kherimoya
    <li><b>Move to python instead of shell</b> <i>(currently being worked on)</i>
    <li><b>Better scripts, ones that do not rely on a project path declared in the scripts</b> <i>(currently being worked on)</i>
    <li><s>More features like server status, discord bot, etc... (discord bot may just become extension)</s> <i>Features like this will be a part of Kherimoya+.)</i>
    <li>Automatic server backups
    <li>Extensions
</ul>
The following features <strong>MAY</strong> be includeded in Kherimoya in the future
<ul>
    <li>Custom API for Endstone plugins
    <li><s>Native Windows compatability</s> <i>We will force users to use WSL rather than making it compatible. This is because Kherimoya will heavily rely on tmux</i>
</ul>

Kherimoya **will** be mostly just a backend for server management. This means you could make your own UI's, and ways of management *(e.g. A server hosting service which uses Kherimoya in the backend.)*
Kherimoya+ will be an optional extension which adds a bunch of different non-essential features into Kherimoya. This is to keep regular Kherimoya lightweight.

## setup

As this is unfinished, **you can't really set this up**, I'm sorry.
